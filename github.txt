Easily recovers file
if multiple ppl are working on the same code base and if someone commited some code then wecan easily identify who 
commited faulty code
we can rollback to previously working state

working directory
staging area
git directory


1.).1.).1).git status

git init

first statging then commit

git add .   ---> to throw the code in stage/staging area

git commit -m "version1"

git log

git config --global user.name "jangal mangal"

git config --global user.email "abc.def@gmail.com"

git show 99a5c04e047a2564ee84b2d84f7ee45e7a7b78f7(Hash String)

git show 99a5c04e047a2564ee84b2d84f7ee45e7a7b78f7 > newfilename.txt(a "newfilename.txt" will be ceated in the directory with changes commited)

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "prateekmitel@yahoo.com"

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:dhawanp/GitTutts.git

$ git push -u origin master

$ git diff jarvis.txt

$ git diff --staged jarvis.txt (To view the diff for staged fie when git add . has been performed on the file to throw
it into the staging area)

once you make changes to some file and save it but we have not yet commited it , just reached to staging process , then we
can undo the changes by simply reset and checkout commands of git by the following commands-:
$ git reset jarvis.txt
$ git checkout jarvis.txt

git clone git@github.com:dhawanp/GitTutts.git

$ git clone git@github.com:dhawanp/GitTutts.git .(this will create a cloned repository in the place where we will use git bashe here)
